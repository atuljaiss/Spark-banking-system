             This upcoming September TSF will be sponsoring workshops with SINDA(Singapore Indian Development Association) in five different schools. These talks will be focused on soft skills such as flexibility, conflict resolution, and time management. These talks are vital because schools tend to not focus on developing these skills, instead, they rely on the students to learn them as they get older. These skills are vital for success in both their school life and their personal lives. TSF aims to improve not only the education aspect of their school experience but also the personal aspect as well. It is in ways like this that TSF aspires to inspire young people to reach out to achieve their maximum potential both in their educational and personal lives. TSF wants to ensure that all students have the skills to achieve anything they set their minds to, and if they need an extra step to achieve that, TSF has got them covered. </p>
